# SET Card Recognition
Goal: Create a mobile app to take pictures of SET cards and recognize if a set exists in the given cards

Using https://medium.com/@dganais/ready-set-image-recognition-720be22d7051 as a starting point, we want to
explore image recognition strategies to accurately identify SETs in a group of cards.

## Data

There are 81 distinct SET cards. 

The attributes of these cards can be divided into 4 categories:

 * Shapes: diamond (D), oval (O), squiggle (S)
 * Color: red (R), green (G), purple (P)
 * Pattern: full (F), striped (S), empty (E)
 * Number: one (1), two (2), three (3)

 ## Stages
 
 **1. Collect the data.**
 Goal is to get at least 100 images for each card type. In addition, we will add images from Anais Dotis's and Tom White's githubs to supplement our data. 
 
 **2. Start with three card types and create a neural network classifier.**
 
 Goal is to learn how to do image processing and create a convolutional neural network that can accurately classify three cards. 
 
 **3. Expand to all 81 card types and develop a neural network classifier.**
 
 **4. Image segmention**
 
 **5. Develop the app using Android Studio. **
