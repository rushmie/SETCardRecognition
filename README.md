# SETImageRecognition
Goal: Create a mobile app to take pictures of SET cards and recognize if a set exists in the given cards.

Using https://medium.com/@dganais/ready-set-image-recognition-720be22d7051 as a starting point, we want to
explore image recognition strategies to accurately identify SETs in a group of cards.

## Data

There are 81 distinct SET cards. 

The attributes of these cards can be divided into 4 categories:

 * Shapes: diamond (D), oval (O), squiggle (S)
 * Color: red (R), green (G), purple (P)
 * Pattern: full (F), striped (S), empty (E)
 * Number: one (1), two (2), three (3)
