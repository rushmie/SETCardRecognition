# SETImageRecognition
Goal: Create a mobile app to take pictures of SET cards and recognize if a set exists in the given cards.

Using https://medium.com/@dganais/ready-set-image-recognition-720be22d7051 as a starting point, we want to
explore image recognition strategies to accurately identify SETs in a group of cards.
